### CURRENTLY BROKEN, BEING UPDATED ###

(12/4/24)

I am currently in the process of fully updating my NPCs! So far their basic coding is done, and I am updating art at the moment. Below is a list of things that will change!

~

Denver is from the bustling city of Opportunity. After having a disagreement with his mother, Alison, he decided to pack up and move to the idyllic Pelican Town to reconnect with his uncle Marlon.

Naturally, Marlon wants Denver to become a great monster hunter like himself, but Denver is less than interested in things like that... in fact, the topic hits a bit close to home.


Through a series of events, you can find out his secrets and why he's so hesitant to take part in his uncle's profession.

### LIST OF UPCOMING CHANGES ###

- Fully updated code
- Improved and new events
- Option to have cabin in the woods instead of living in the saloon (not SVE compatible)

- Unique gift responses, including ones if you have certain mods installed
