### CURRENTLY BROKEN, I PROMISE HE WILL BE UPDATED SOMEDAY ###

Denver is from the bustling city of Opportunity. After having a disagreement with his mother, Alison, he decided to pack up and move to the idyllic Pelican Town to reconnect with his uncle Marlon.

Naturally, Marlon wants Denver to become a great monster hunter like himself, but Denver is less than interested in things like that... in fact, the topic hits a bit close to home.


Through a series of events, you can find out his secrets and why he's so hesitant to take part in his uncle's profession.
